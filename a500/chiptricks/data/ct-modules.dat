The very first Amiga demo I saw was brilliant "Extension" by Pygmy
Projects. I was totally blown away by those awesome effects and "dot city"
is still among my favorites. But what probably struck me strongest was the
music.  Jester did amazing job. Amazing job. For me "Cyber Ride" is one of
the best modules ever, it's excellent - musically and technically.
Thank you, Mr Volker Tripp.

My love for chiptunes was evolving for many years and Emax's ProTracker chips
had great impact on my musical taste. I love quite many from his list, but is
"Delicate 0ooz!" my favorite one? To tell you the truth, I don't know,
but isn't that beautiful? :)

A catchy tune originally made by Dime/Decnite for The Party 3 compo in 1993.
I like how the instruments are interleaved, giving the illusion of more than 4
tracks playing at once. Studying such well made mods is a good way to learn new
tracking techniques. I have made the intro longer by one pattern as it deserved
it, while I have cut out the second part of the mod which was IMHO a bit boring.
Greets to my friend Rudi (wherever you are now), I have found this mod in one of
your CDs back in the days.

I love racing games and my two favorite Amiga racing games are "Jaguar XJ220"
and "Lotus III: The Ultimate Challenge". Personally I prefer "Jaguar XJ220", but
in terms of music those games were equally great. "Miami Ice" is one of the best
tracks in history of Amiga games. I just love the melody, it's so energetic, I
just wanted to drive as fast as I could! :) Masterpiece.

Ok, it's Mice here writing some crap, only because I promised to Jazzcat that
I'd write something. Hmmh, where to start...  Can't believe that this thing is
actually released, it's been seven years since I made my remixes for it :)
I don't really have much to say, but here's some information about the two tunes
I made. First of all sorry for those who expected them to be real remixes. When
I started to make them Jazzcat had told me that he wants remix-tunes, but for
some reason (maybe the respect for the originals) I ended up just making
ahx-conversions. There's really not much difference to the originals, so calling
them remixes would be wrong.  I think the first tune I finished was
Madness2-part B by the great 4-mat. If I remember correctly, I chose this one
because the instruments were so easy to make for it. It sounds pretty much like
the original, which also makes this one pretty pointless, but what is done is
done :)

Olof Gustafsson will always be remembered by Amiga users all over the world
because of his tremendous work as a musician. He composed so many great tracks
for Amiga games and it is not easy to tell which one is the best. But for me it
wasn't hard decision "Pinball Illusions" title tune is the one. Beautiful pads
and excellent chords in second part this is what made my day back then and what
kicks my ass to the present day.

It's from an intro by Digital called Afternoon. Original was made by Hollywood
and Reverse in 1993. I made my version exactly ten years after in 2003 and for
some reason I started to think that this chippack wouldn't be released 'til 2013
:) I think I promised to make more tunes if I have the time and inspiration, but
I guess that never happened. Oh well, I'm sure Jazzcat (and maybe others) have
made plenty of nice remixes for you to enjoy so, eh, go and enjoy them. I'm
outta here...

OK, to be frank, I don't remember even a single effect from the Rebels demo
called "Switchback". But what carved its name in my head for years was this
great soundtrack composed by Chromag. A lot, lot of awesomeness.
